# react-tenzies-scrimba
This beginner project is from react course in scrimba
that I took, I added a modal, timer and roll counter in order to test my knowledge in react.

Please do bare with me if i have so many comments. I purposedly put a lot of it, because I want to understand clearly the code when I get back to it.
